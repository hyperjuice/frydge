Welcome to the README file of the frydge app. This si the first web app I've built, and I owe it to the WDI SF 17 satff at General Assembly.
This app is dedicated to my wife, Leah Kahn, who is the best cook and partner. Thanks to Yummly.com for giving me free access to their amazing API!

1. Tables: The app should have at least 2 database tables with an association.
2. External APIs: Use an external API to add functionality to the app.
3. Authentication: The app should have an authentication component.
4. Authorization: Where appropriate, an authorization scheme should be implemented.
5. Heroku: Deploy the app to Heroku.
