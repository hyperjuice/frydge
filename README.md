Welcome to the README file of the frydge app. This is the first web app I've built, and I owe it to the WDI SF 17 staff at General Assembly.
This app is dedicated to my wife, Leah Kahn, who is the best cook and partner. Thanks to Yummly.com for giving me free access to their amazing API!
--------

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. Tables: The app should have at least 2 database tables with an association.
2. External APIs: Use an external API to add functionality to the app.
3. Authentication: The app should have an authentication component.
4. Authorization: Where appropriate, an authorization scheme should be implemented.
5. Heroku: Deploy the app to Heroku. 

COMPLETED PROJECT DELIVERABLES:

1. Link to the website hosted on Heroku
2. Link to the source code on GitHub

DISCLAIMER:
This app was built in 4 days, and is not meant to be a 100% fully functioning, beautifully styled product. The MVP works, and I'm proud of it!
